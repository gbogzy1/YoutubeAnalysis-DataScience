# YoutubeAnalysis-DataScience

<p>
   Since recently becoming an avid youtube user and wanting to enter the realm of content creation with a new YouTube channel dedicated to building projects with Python(Vlog style content). 
  <br><br> I have embarked on a quest to gain valuable insights on this subject, which can prove beneficial to other novice content creators. 
  <br><br> It is important to note that the scope of this endeavor is limited to one Youtube channel, and other niches with distinct characteristics and audience bases will not be considered. 
  <br><br> Consequently, this project will delve into the statistical analysis of my favourite youtube channel at the moment ("Obi Vincent") by comparing the last 50 videos uploaded to see if there is any correlation between the variables mentioned in the first paragraph and viewership.
  <br><br> I will be making use of <b><i> Google's Youtube API V3 </i></b> for my DATA source.
